# Projects

## Acoustic Micropatterning Platform
A customizable acoustic field that patterns hPSCs into controlled geometries.  
- Non-invasive  
- Tunable pattern sizes  
- Compatible with long-term culture and live imaging  
- Used to study early epiblast organization

---

## Microfluidic Embryoid Culture System
A microfluidic device that mimics nutrient flow and mechanical boundaries found in early human embryos.  
Supports human explant culture with precise modulation of spatial cues.

---

## Organoid Morphogenesis in Engineered Environments
Exploring how physical and biochemical microenvironments influence early organoid shape, identity, and organization.
