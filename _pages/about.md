# Hi, I'm **Zhaoyi Xu** 👋

I’m a PhD researcher working at the intersection of **mechanical engineering**, **developmental biology**, and **microfluidics**.  
I build **biomimetic in vitro systems** that recreate early human embryonic environments, with a special interest in:

- acoustic patterning of human pluripotent stem cells  
- early epiblast development  
- microfluidic platforms for organoid and explant culture  

I’m passionate about designing simple systems that reveal complex biological principles — and bridging engineering with fundamental developmental biology.

If you’re interested in collaborating or chatting about development, microfluidics, or stem-cell engineering, feel free to reach out!
